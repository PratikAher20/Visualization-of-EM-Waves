# Visualization of EM Waves
A simulation project accomplished during third semester of Electronics and Communication (Avionics) Engineering.
## Contents
1. E and H fields forming standing waves at the Dielectric and Perfect Electric Conductor Interface.
2. Animations showing polarization vector for Left handed and Right handed circular polarization.
3. Animations showing movement of phase velocity and group velocity component within an EM wave for different cases.
